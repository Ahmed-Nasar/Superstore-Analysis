# Sample Superstore Dashboard

- Dashboards can be a helpfull tool to provide insights into sales performance and trends of an organization.
- The dashboard should include key metrics such as total sales, sales by product, sales by location, sales by customer segment, and sales by product category.
- It should also provide comparisons of performance to prior years, and allow for drill-down into individual market and products.

## Problem Statement:
- Build a Sales Analysis Dashboard.

## Tools Used:
- Microsoft Excel

## Data:
- Data Source : [Sample Superstore Dataset from kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bravehart101/sample-supermarket-dataset)

## Dashboards:
In the beginning, the case was just data for a company that did not indicate any useful information that would help decision-makers. In this case, I had to ask questions that could help extract and explore information that would help decision-makers improve and evaluate performance.
#### But before that, I did some operations in the data to help me to analyze it accurately: 
 - Understand the data. 
 - Clean the data “By power query”. 
 - insert some calculation and columns like “COGS” cost of goods sold by power query. 
 - Modeling the data and adding some measures and other columns to help me in analysis.

#### Then I asked these questions: 
### To Enhance Customer Loyalty: 
- What is the most used ship mode by our customer? 
- Who are our top 5 customers in terms of sales and order frequency? 
### To monitor our strength and weak points:
- Which segment of clients generates the most sales? 
- Which city has the most sales value? 
- Which state generates the most sales value? 
### Performance measurement:
- What are the top performing product categories in terms of sales and profit? 
- What is the most profitable product that we sell? 
- What is the lowest profitable product that we sell? 
### Customer Experience:
- On Average how long does it take the orders to reach our clients? Based on each Shipping Mode
